# API Documentation Basics

This repository offers guidance on the fundamentals of creating effective API documentation. It provides insights into structuring documentation, content best practices, and tools to help maintain clear and concise documentation for API users.

## Introduction

Good API documentation is crucial for enabling users to understand how to effectively use an API. This guide will cover the essentials of creating and maintaining useful API documentation.

## Contents

1. **Overview of API**
   - Provide a high-level description of what the API does and its target audience.

2. **Authentication**
   - Explain how to authenticate with the API, including obtaining and using authentication tokens.

3. **Endpoints**
   - Detailed descriptions of each endpoint, including paths, parameters, expected responses, and error codes.

4. **Examples**
   - Provide practical examples of common use cases, demonstrating requests and responses.

5. **Error Handling**
   - Document common errors, their meanings, and how to resolve them.

6. **Change Log**
   - Keep a log of changes to the API, including new features, deprecated endpoints, and changes to existing functionality.

## Tools for API Documentation

- **Swagger (OpenAPI):** Allows you to define APIs in YAML or JSON that generates an interactive API documentation and a UI to explore the API.
- **Postman:** Useful for creating and sharing documentation from collections of API requests.
- **Read the Docs:** A platform that allows you to create, maintain, and host documentation.

## Example Section - Authentication

```markdown
### Authentication

All API requests require authentication. This API uses token-based authentication via the `Authorization` header.

Example of including an API token in the header:

\`\`\`bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_TOKEN" https://api.example.com/data
\`\`\`
```
